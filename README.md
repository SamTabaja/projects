This repo contains some for FUN work
## myWebSite folder
This website was made just for fun and to test some HTML/CSS and JavaScript and it is still incompleted.
## In myWebSite you can find that it is:
* Responsive.
* The contact form is validated with javaScript.
* The text used are either some real information about me or some random text just to fill the page.
* All images were captures by me except for the background image at the very top.  
* It was inspired from [www.devonstank.com](https://www.devonstank.com/).
